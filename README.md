  <a href="https://github.com/raedjah1/BOPMapsBackend.git">GitHub Repository</a>
</p>



BOPMaps is a music-meets-location app that lets users drop and discover songs pinned to real-world places. It transforms everyday walks into audio adventures — each location becomes a memory, a vibe, a story told through music.

**Built With:**
- **Frontend:** Flutter-based interactive map UI with pin drop, collection, and friend features
- **Backend:** Django REST API handling user auth, pins, music metadata, and geolocation logic

**Core Features:**
- 🎧 Drop music pins at physical locations
- 🌐 Discover songs based on where you are
- 🧠 Pins include metadata like rarity, genre, and vibes
- 🤝 Social features: friend system, collection history
- 🌈 Gamified layers: proximity auras, collectible skins

**Purpose:** This is my final deliverable for the Human-Computer Interaction course at Colgate University. It showcases thoughtful interaction design, rapid prototyping, and meaningful user experience — merging sound, space, and memory.
